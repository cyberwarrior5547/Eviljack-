## What is QRLJacking?
---  

QRLJacking, also known as Quick Response Code Login Jacking, is a straightforward yet highly malicious attack method that targets applications utilizing the "Login with QR code" feature as a supposedly secure means of account access. The primary objective of this attack is to hijack users' sessions, enabling attackers to gain unauthorized access to their accounts

- Scroll down to the "Downloads" section and click on "tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.x.x.exe" (where "x.x" represents the version number) to download the Windows installer for Tesseract OCR.

## Run the Tesseract Installer
- Double-click on the downloaded "tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.x.x.exe" file to run the installer.

- Choose Components (Optional)
During the installation, you will be asked to select the components to install. You can keep the default options or customize them based on your needs. At a minimum, make sure the "Tesseract OCR" component is selected.

---
- Run evil_jack.py and server.py

- Now send the phishing link `127.0.0.1:5000` to victim . Note the link `127.0.0.1:5000` only work if victim connected to same network .To perform the attack outside the wan use ngrok or portmap.io 
- After the victim scans the code, you will gain access to his WhatsApp session. Additionally, after the victim has scanned the QR code, he will be automatically redirected to a fake verification page
